    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p><em>Our Information Visualization course project initially explored U.S. housing affordability, pivoting to a more focused study on homeless populations and rent growth correlations. Our shift stemmed from a desire to understand and highlight the relationship between rental trends and homelessness. By analyzing this correlation, our goal is to offer crucial insights into housing inequality, aiming to contribute meaningfully to solutions for the homeless population's challenges.</em></p>

    
    <h1>Visualization</h1>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p>Our interactive design prioritizes offering users a comprehensive overview of the New England area's current situation. We place an emphasis on three components visualizing rent growth in different regions, presenting homeless population variations over time, and providing users with an average homeless population figure for the entire New England area. It allows users to select their preferred state and track changes in the variation of homeless population and rent growth over the years. Enabling them to delve into specific data for a more localized perspective, all while maintaining an overarching view of the New England area as a whole. </p>

    <p>The primary objective of our visualization is to introduce fundamental information, followed by a gradual presentation of our analysis regarding the relationship between homeless population and rent growth in different areas. This approach equips our audience with the necessary context to comprehend the socioeconomic implications of housing inequality at the neighborhood level.

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>
    <img src="images/Hongqian_sketch1.jpg" alt="Hongqian's sketch">
    <p> Initially, we planned to connect three graphs by selecting a state on one to highlight it on the others. However, we pivoted to a separate map and incorporated tooltips. This change allows us to present specific state data, such as monthly rent and homeless population, in a more focused manner.</p>
    <img src="images/Minjie sketch 3.PNG" alt="Minjie's sketch">
    <p> At first we were planning to implement area charts to represent the variation of homeless population over years because we think area charts could better convey information about how does things works differently on people from different background.</p>
    <img src="images/yixuan_sketch1.png" alt="Yixuan's sketch">
    <p>This graph offers users a visual representation of the ratio between rent growth rates and homeless population across various states. We later realize overall population should be included when considering homeless popualtion among different areas.</p>
    <img src="images/zuhaeer-sketch-3.png" alt="Zuhaeer's sketch">  
    <p>In contrast to a conventional pie chart, this one introduces an approach by using images to represent each gender category with the size of these images conrresponding to the population distribution.</p>
